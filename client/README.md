### `IssueCard`

Issue card with optional cluster badges:

- 🔥 _"N people reported this issue nearby"_ — cluster primary
- LOCATION: _"Part of a nearby cluster"_ — cluster member

### `IssueMap`

Leaflet map with:

- 🔴🟡🟢 Colour-coded status markers
- **Orange oversized circles** for cluster hotspots (radius scales with reporter count)
- Cluster count shown in popup

### `IssueDetail`

- **Citizen view**: Anonymous cluster alert — count only, no names.
- **Government view**: Full reporter table with status badges + cascade hint on the update form.
