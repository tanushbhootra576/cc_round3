## Troubleshooting

| Issue                    | Fix                                        |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| MongoDB connection fails | Check `MONGO_URI` in `.env`                |
| CORS errors              | Ensure `CLIENT_URL` matches frontend port  |
| Socket.IO not connecting | Verify backend/frontend use same port      |
| Images not uploading     | Create `backend/uploads/issues/` directory |
| Map doesn't show tiles   | Import Leaflet CSS in `IssueMap.jsx`       |

## Core Architecture

```
Frontend (React 18)
  ├─ AuthContext (user, token)
  ├─ SocketContext (real-time updates)
  └─ pages/components (Landing, Auth, Dashboards, Issues)
        ↓ (REST API + WebSocket)
Backend (Express + Socket.IO)
  ├─ Auth routes (JWT-based)
  ├─ Issue routes (CRUD + clustering)
  └─ Real-time notifications
        ↓ (Mongoose ODM)
MongoDB
  ├─ Users collection
  └─ Issues collection (geo-indexed with 2dsphere)
```

| **IoT as Socket.IO broadcast vs stored records** | IoT ghost reports are broadcast-only signals — not stored in MongoDB — to keep the demonstration clean. In production, sensor readings would create real issue documents via the same `POST /api/issues` flow, requiring no frontend changes beyond swapping the source. |
